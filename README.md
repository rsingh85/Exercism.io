# Exercism.io Progamming Exercises #

[exercism.io](http://exercism.io) is a series of programming exercises in multiple languages in which you are given a problem and a series of unit tests to verify your solution to the problem. Once you have solved the problem, you submit your answer to and it is reviewed by your peers. It is an excellent practice in Test Driven Development and a great opportunity to write code that solves a problem as simply as possible while keeping it readable and expressive.
